# ***2. paired t-test and effect size***

The Barley data set gives the yields of two types of barley - Glabron and Velvet across twelve different fields.
The data is paired as yields are given for both types of barley across each of the twelve fields.

```{R}
#library(MASS)
library(PairedData) # you might need to install the package first
data("Barley")
detach('package:PairedData', unload=TRUE)
detach('package:MASS', unload=TRUE)
# unload package because it contains another select() function
head(Barley, 4)
```

## **2 (Q.1)**

```{R}
Glabron <- Barley $ Glabron
Velvet <- Barley $ Velvet

t.test(x = Glabron, y = Velvet, paired = TRUE)

```

We get the p-value is 0.0118. This value is greater than signification level 0.1, so we reject the hypothesis that the difference is 0
