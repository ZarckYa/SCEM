## Wave Plot

#### Generate a sequence number by 0.01 from 0 to 20, with sine calculation
```{R}
x <- seq(0, 20, 0.01)
y <- sin(x)
```
#### Create a data frame with x and y
```{R}
sin_df <- data.frame(x,y)
headOfSin <- head(sin_df,3)
headOfSin
```
#### Plot the sine function in wave
```{R}
plot(sin_df)
```

#### A simple equation

\begin{equation}

sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

(\#eq:sin)

\end{equation}


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
